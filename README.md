# Aviation Risk Analysis

**Data-driven. Risk-aware. Investment-ready.**

## Business Problem

Venturing into aviation demands precision. Accidents are rare, but when they happen, the consequences are enormous: regulatory friction, reputational damage, financial loss, and operational downtime.

The challenge? Spotting where the risks are before they turn into costs.

## Data-Driven Goal

Use historical aviation incident data to **classify, quantify, and visualize** operational risk. This isnâ€™t just about understanding the past itâ€™s about equipping investors and aviation stakeholders with a **forward-looking lens** on flight safety, aircraft performance, and risk patterns across geographies and flight phases.

## Decision Context

Smart capital needs clarity. This analysis surfaces:

* When and where aviation incidents most commonly occur
* Which aircraft and engine types are disproportionately exposed
* What phases of flight pose higher operational risk

These insights form the foundation for **risk-adjusted decision making**, especially for early-stage aviation investments, lease agreements, or route launches.
