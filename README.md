Aviation Risk Analysis  
**Data-driven. Risk-aware. Investment-ready.**



## Business Problem  
Venturing into aviation, especially in the early stages, demands precision. Accidents, while rare, carry massive costs not just in damages, but in downtime, regulatory scrutiny, and reputation. The challenge? Identifying where and when the risk is most concentrated before it turns into cost.



## Data-Driven Goal  
Build a system that classifies and quantifies aviation risks using historical data. Not just to observe, but to predict. To give investors and stakeholders a proactive lens on operational safety and performance patterns.



## Decision Context  
This analysis highlights where the risks are concentrated, how often they occur, and under what conditions — offering a clear lens into operational realities. It’s the kind of insight that supports smart, early-stage investment decisions with lower exposure and higher control.
